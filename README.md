 Vibe Matcher – Nexora AI Challenge
This project is a simple recommendation system that helps match fashion products to the kind of vibe a user is feeling — like "urban chic" or "cozy minimalist."
💡 Why AI at Nexora?
At Nexora, AI isn’t just about making things faster — it’s about making things feel right. This notebook shows how we can use AI to understand moods and match them to products, so shopping feels more personal and expressive.
▶️ How to Use It
- Open the notebook in Google Colab or VS Code.
- Install the required Python packages (listed in requirements.txt).
- Run the notebook and type in a vibe like "bold streetwear" or "romantic vintage".
- The system will show you the best-matching product based on that vibe.
🧠 How It Works
- It uses a pre-trained AI model to turn product descriptions and vibes into numbers (called embeddings).
- Then it compares those numbers to find which product is closest to the vibe you entered.
- If no good match is found, it shows a friendly message asking you to try a different vibe.
🚀 What’s Next
- Connect it to a bigger product database so it can handle thousands of items.
- Add image matching so it can recommend based on product photos too.
- Make it even smarter by combining text and visuals.
